Application Samples
===================

* * *
Introduction
------------

Included in this sample is sample jQuery and Trapeze js code to make the app run.  When using in your 
own project, import these apps from Trapezes JavaScriptAps.  This application doesn't require any specific CSS

Linking your Application to the Samples
---------------------------------------

In order for the samples to be viewable directly through http://office.trapeze.com/svn, you should create relative links from your sample `.html` file pointing to the `dist` folder of your application. e.g:

        <script type="text/javascript" src="../../dist/[TODO: app-name].js"></script>


**NOTES**:

- **DO NOT** copy your application files over to the `docs/samples/media/`, so you don't have to replicate the changes done in samples to the main files of the application.

- **DO NOT** change the files on the `app-name/dist` folder this folder should be generated using the instructions on the application `README` file. Use the `app-name/src/` files to make any changes to your application.

- If your `app-name/dist` folder also include `CSS files`, images, or any other required asset please link directly to these as well from inside your `.html` sample file.
